I'll create a summary of the key points for when we resume work tomorrow:
Project Summary: SBCC (Santa Barbara Chef Collective) Website
Core Files We're Working With:
modal.js: Handles modal and accordion functionality
airtable-integration.js: Manages data fetching from Airtable
modal-styles.css: Contains styling for modals and components
Current Implementation Status:
Modal system is implemented with open/close functionality
Accordion system is working with smooth animations
Data loading functions for chefs and menus are in place
Airtable integration is set up with proper error handling
Key Areas We're Working On:
Chef data loading with proper image handling
Menu data organization by courses (Appetizers, Main, Sides, Dessert)
Responsive grid layouts for both chefs and menus
Error handling for data fetching
Known Issues to Address:
Image path handling needs to consistently use /SBCC-Images/ prefix
Field name mismatches between Airtable and frontend
Connection handling for Airtable requests
Modal content width issues with close button
Development Environment:
Running on local http-server (typically port 8081 or 8082)
Workspace path: /Users/mark/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Mixed Grill/Clients : Projects/Coco/SBCC-website
Next Steps:
Continue refining the chef and menu grid layouts
Improve error handling for data loading
Enhance responsive design for mobile views
Optimize image loading and fallbacks
When resuming tomorrow, starting with "We're working on the SBCC website, specifically the modal and data loading functionality" will help quickly get back into context
