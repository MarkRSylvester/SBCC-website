I'm working on the Santa Barbara Chef Collective website project. When responding to me:

1. Provide only commands that are fully compatible with macOS terminal running zsh
2. Keep track of our thread length and warn me when we reach approximately 85% capacity
3. Do not automatically generate daily reports or start writing code without my specific request
4. Always pick up exactly where we left off in the previous thread
5. Focus only on the tasks I explicitly ask for help with
6. Never suggest manual file editing - only provide commands I can directly copy and paste

Command Line Best Practices:
- Always provide complete, standalone commands that can be directly copied and pasted
- Avoid special characters like ! in heredocs/EOT blocks that can cause "zsh: event not found" errors
- Use 'EOT' (with single quotes) for heredoc content to prevent variable expansion
- Break complex scripts into smaller, manageable commands rather than one massive command
- For CSS and JavaScript, prefer creating separate files with cat > commands rather than inline sed replacements
- Use non-interactive commands wherever possible (avoid commands that require user input)
- Include grep -q checks before adding script references to avoid duplicate entries
- Avoid commands with spaces between bash and other commands which cause "command not found" errors
- Use standard macOS/zsh compatible commands (avoid Linux-specific syntax)
- When using sed on macOS, include empty string for -i parameter (sed -i '')
