Instructions for Continuing SBCC Website Modal Implementation
Copy and paste the following information in our new thread to continue seamlessly:

I'm working on the Santa Barbara Chef Collective website project, specifically fixing accordion functionality in the modal. We've already implemented a new solution and now need to continue with testing and cleanup.
We've created these files:
	•	public/css/montecito-modal.css (new modal styling)
	•	public/js/montecito-modal.js (new modal functionality)
Current status:
	1	We implemented a new modal with proper accordions following the Montecito Mom styling
	2	We need to test the implementation and possibly make refinements
	3	We need to clean up the codebase for client handoff
When responding to me:
	1	Provide only commands that are fully compatible with macOS terminal running zsh
	2	For heredoc syntax in zsh, use 'EOT' (with single quotes) to prevent variable expansion
	3	For sed commands on macOS, use -i '' format with empty string parameter
	4	Break complex scripts into manageable commands
	5	Use standard macOS/zsh compatible commands
We already created several shell scripts including:
	•	analyze-conflicts.sh - For analyzing code conflicts
	•	cleanup-codebase.sh - For cleaning up redundant files
	•	new-modal-implementation.sh - For implementing the new modal
Let's continue with testing the new implementation and proceed with the cleanup process to ensure a professional codebase for client handoff.

Remember that any zsh commands should:
	1	Use single quotes for heredocs to prevent variable expansion: << 'EOT'
	2	Include empty string for sed's in-place option: sed -i ''
	3	Avoid bash-specific syntax that might not work in zsh
	4	Be fully compatible with macOS terminal
When we continue, we'll focus on:
	1	Testing the new modal implementation
	2	Making any necessary refinements
	3	Running the cleanup process
	4	Finalizing the codebase for a professional handoff
