SAFE ACCORDION FIX APPROACH:

1. First, run the diagnostic script to understand the current state:
   - Open your website and the modal
   - Open browser dev tools and go to Console
   - Paste the content of accordion-diagnostic.js
   - Check the output to understand what's happening with accordions

2. If accordions are staying open, try refreshing the page to reset state

3. Apply just the divider style fix without changing anything else:
   - Paste the content of minimal-divider-fix.js
   - This should ONLY affect divider styling

4. Separately, apply the text size fix:
   - Paste the content of our-story-text-fix.js
   - This should ONLY affect text size in Our Story

This approach separates concerns and minimizes the chance of breaking existing functionality.

IMPORTANT: If you've added multiple script files in previous attempts, they might be conflicting. Consider removing extra script tags from your HTML before trying these fixes.
