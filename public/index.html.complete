              <h4>About Santa Barbara Chef Collective</h4>
              <p>We're a community of local chefs dedicated to making private dining easy, personal, and unforgettable. Whether it's an intimate dinner, a milestone celebration, or a relaxed weekend retreat, we match you with the perfect chef—someone who brings your vision to life through thoughtfully prepared, beautifully presented food.</p>
              <p>Founded by Coco—a former private yacht chef whose culinary journey began in the markets of France and carried her across the globe—we believe food should feel both elevated and deeply personal. From cooking for royalty on the high seas to families here in Santa Barbara, Coco's love for local ingredients and inspired menus now fuels a growing collective of chefs who share that same passion for connection and creativity.</p>
              <p>At the heart of everything we do is community. We partner with local farms, fishers, and artisans to ensure every dish reflects the vibrant flavors of California's Central Coast. With global talent, local roots, and genuine hospitality, we're here to help.</p>

              <h4>Welcome to the Santa Barbara Chef Collective</h4>
              <p>We're a community of local chefs on a shared mission: to make private dining effortless—and unforgettable. Whether you're planning an intimate dinner, a wedding, or a weekend retreat, we'll match you with the perfect chef to bring your vision to life through thoughtful, beautifully prepared food.</p>
              <h4>Our Founder's Story</h4>
              <p><strong>Coco's Journey:</strong> I had the joy of being a private yacht chef for eight years, cooking for royalty, celebrities, and adventurers while sailing the globe. But my passion for food began earlier, in the fresh markets of France, where I fell in love with seasonal ingredients, aged cheeses, and the art of gathering.</p>
              <p>Motivated by that culture, I trained at Tante Marie's in San Francisco and have never stopped cooking since. From buying octopus in a Greek village to slicing fresh-caught sashimi in Alaska, I've always believed food should reflect where you are and who you're with.</p>
              <p>Now rooted in Santa Barbara and close to family, I cook for local events and gatherings using vibrant, organic California ingredients. I specialize in Mediterranean and raw cuisine and love meals that make you feel great, body and soul.</p>
              <p>Founding the Chef Collective let me bring together a team of chefs who care deeply about food, craft, and connection. I'm so glad you're here.<br>— Coco</p>
