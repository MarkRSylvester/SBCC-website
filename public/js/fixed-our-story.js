            <p>I had the joy of being a private yacht chef for eight years, cooking for royalty, celebrities, and adventurers while sailing the globe. But my passion for food began earlier, in the fresh markets of France, where I fell in love with seasonal ingredients, aged cheeses, and the art of gathering.</p>
            <p>Motivated by that culture, I trained at Tante Marie's in San Francisco and have never stopped cooking since. From buying octopus in a Greek village to slicing fresh-caught sashimi in Alaska, I've always believed food should reflect where you are and who you're with.</p>
            <p>Now rooted in Santa Barbara and close to family, I cook for local events and gatherings using vibrant, organic California ingredients. I specialize in Mediterranean and raw cuisine and love meals that make you feel great, body and soul.</p>
            <p>Founding the Chef Collective let me bring together a team of chefs who care deeply about food, craft, and connection. I'm so glad you're here.</p>
