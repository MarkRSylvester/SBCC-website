Our Story
Welcome to the Santa Barbara Chef Collective
We're a community of local chefs on a shared mission: to make private dining effortless—and unforgettable. Whether you're planning an intimate dinner, a wedding, or a weekend retreat, we'll match you with the perfect chef to bring your vision to life through thoughtful, beautifully prepared food.

Our Founder's Story

I had the joy of being a private yacht chef for eight years, cooking for royalty, celebrities, and adventurers while sailing the globe. But my passion for food began earlier, in the fresh markets of France, where I fell in love with seasonal ingredients, aged cheeses, and the art of gathering.
Motivated by that culture, I trained at Tante Marie's in San Francisco and have never stopped cooking since. From buying octopus in a Greek village to slicing fresh-caught sashimi in Alaska, I've always believed food should reflect where you are and who you're with.
Now rooted in Santa Barbara and close to family, I cook for local events and gatherings using vibrant, organic California ingredients. I specialize in Mediterranean and raw cuisine and love meals that make you feel great, body and soul.
Founding the Chef Collective let me bring together a team of chefs who care deeply about food, craft, and connection. I'm so glad you're here.

Global Talent, Local Roots
From Michelin-trained masters to creative culinary artisans, our chefs bring world-class skill to Santa Barbara tables. Every chef is personally vetted and selected not just for talent, but for hospitality and heart.

Connecting Great Chefs with Great Clients
Our platform makes it easy to browse and connect with top local chefs. Every detail is handled with care, so you can focus on the experience, not the logistics.

Celebrating Local Flavor
We partner with Santa Barbara farmers, fishers, and foragers to create dishes that reflect the vibrant spirit of the Central Coast. Every meal is a celebration of community, seasonality, and creativity.

The Process
	1	Chef Selection Once you reach out, we'll send you curated resumes from chefs matched to your tastes, event style, and household needs.
	2	Personal Interviews You'll meet the chefs to ensure their style, personality, and creativity align with your vision.
	3	The Perfect Match With our guidance, you'll choose the chef who best fits the bill—someone who will turn your gathering into something truly memorable.
