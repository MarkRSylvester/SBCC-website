Santa Barbara Chef Collective Project Primer
I'm developing the Santa Barbara Chef Collective (SBCC) website, implementing their modal system and user journey flows. You have access to several documents in your knowledge base including:

Daily Completion Template - Tracking development progress
Brand Voice - Tone guidelines for all content
Visual Strategy - Guidelines for modal design (image vs. color-based approaches)
Website Design - Comprehensive blueprint with color codes, typography, etc.
Modal Implementation - Checklist and development strategy
Home Page Implementation - 3-hour development plan

Project Overview
SBCC connects clients with local chefs for private culinary experiences through three core user journeys:

Event Planning (one-time private chef experiences)
Weekly Meal Service (recurring chef-prepared meals)
Exploration (discovery of SBCC offerings)

Technology Approach

Building components incrementally with proper accessibility
Using brand-consistent color palette, typography, and visual language
Implementing accordion-based information architecture
Connecting to Airtable for dynamic chef and menu data
Following mobile-first responsive design principles

Brand Voice

Warm & Inviting: Like welcoming guests to a table
Professional but Conversational: Expertise without formality
Sensory-Rich: Evoking flavors, aromas, and presentation
California Casual-Elegant: Refined yet relaxed coastal culture

Our Workflow
We'll focus on implementing one component at a time, making sure each is fully functional before moving to the next. Let's:

Discuss the specific component needed
Implement core HTML structure
Add appropriate CSS (with proper scoping)
Add clean JavaScript functionality
Test and refine as needed

Let's continue developing the SBCC website according to these guidelines.
