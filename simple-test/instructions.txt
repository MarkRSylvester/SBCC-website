SUPER SIMPLE ACCORDION IMPLEMENTATION
=====================================

This is an extremely basic accordion implementation that uses old-school
JavaScript techniques to avoid potential conflicts with other scripts.

HOW TO TEST:
-----------
1. Open simple-test/test.html in your browser
2. Click on the accordions to verify they open and close
3. Click the "Check Accordions" button to see debugging info in the console

HOW TO IMPLEMENT:
---------------
1. Add the simple JS file to your HTML:
   <script src="/public/js/simple-accordion.js"></script>

2. Make sure your HTML follows this structure:
   <div class="accordion-item">
     <div class="accordion-header">
       <h3>Title</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="accordion-content">
       Content goes here
     </div>
   </div>

3. For accordions that should be open by default, use:
   <div class="accordion-item active open">
     ...
   </div>

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
If you still have issues:
1. Make sure there are no JavaScript errors in the console
2. Try temporarily disabling all other JavaScript files
3. Check if your HTML structure matches exactly what's expected
4. Use the window.checkAccordions() function to debug

This implementation uses only basic JavaScript features from
ES5 and should work in virtually all browsers without conflicts.
