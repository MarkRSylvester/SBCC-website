SUPER SIMPLE ACCORDION IMPLEMENTATION
=====================================

This is a barebones accordion implementation that uses traditional JavaScript
techniques to avoid conflicts with other scripts.

HOW TO TEST:
-----------
1. Open super-simple/test.html in your browser
2. Click on the accordions to verify they open and close
3. Click the "Debug Accordions" button to see debugging info in the console

HOW TO IMPLEMENT IN YOUR PROJECT:
-------------------------------
1. Add the script to your HTML before the closing </body> tag:
   <script src="/path/to/accordion.js"></script>

2. Ensure your HTML structure follows this pattern:
   <div class="accordion-item">
     <div class="accordion-header">
       <h3>Accordion Title</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="accordion-content">
       Content goes here
     </div>
   </div>

3. For accordions that should be open by default, use:
   <div class="accordion-item active">
     ...
     <div class="accordion-content" style="display: block; padding: 20px;">
       ...
     </div>
   </div>

4. Add the debug function to a button if needed:
   <button onclick="window.debugAccordions()">Debug</button>

TROUBLESHOOTING:
--------------
If you're still having issues:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Use the debugAccordions() function to inspect the state
3. Temporarily disable all other scripts to check for conflicts
4. Ensure your HTML structure exactly matches the expected pattern

This implementation uses only ES5 features for maximum compatibility.
